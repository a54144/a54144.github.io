Greetings. Welcome to my carapace. 

This is Hui Lin from School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Here is my personal website under construction. I would like to share my learing, codings programs, and life here. 

My major is oceanography, or specificlly marine chemistry. 

Here is my backpage, my knowledge pool, and finally my carapace.
