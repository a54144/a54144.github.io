Today I am so happy that I led my team to find the Smarty candy first in Class Frshwtr 504.

This is an impressive way to teach students how to use the software, how to convert different locations between coordinates.

May be I can write a tutorial how to transfer the UTM coordinates to lat/lon, and how to transfer the polar coordinates to x-y coordinates. And also some steps to plot a vector picture.
