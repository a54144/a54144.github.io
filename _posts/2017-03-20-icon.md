I just doodle an icon for this personal website in this very interesting website. It is a combination my initials L and H.
It is very easy to update your website icon by put the following HTML scripts between `<head>` and `</head>` tags in the default page (default.html) in the `_layout` folder.

```
link href="data:image/x-icon;base64,
AAABAAEAEBAQAAEABAAoAQAAFgAAACgAAAAQAAAAIAAAAAEABAAAA
AAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/
