**R/V**: Blue Heron.

**Sample date**: June 14 ~ 21, 2017.

**Data measurements**: UV-Visable spectrom, EEMs, DOC, DN, Size chromotography.

**Sampling sites**:

## DOC concentration, a<sub>254</sub>, and SUVA<sub>254</sub>

Both DOC concentration and a<sub>254</sub> values are consistent with *Zhou et al 2013*. Thy are relatively low in Lake Superior and South Lake Michigan.

## EEMs analysis

Four FDOM components decomposed by parallel factor analysis are shown below.

 __Component1__ is a typical Humic-like component. It contains __peaks A__ (Ex:260 nm, Em:380~460 nm) and __peaks C__ (Ex:330 nm, Em:420~480 nm).  It was the most intense peak in all fluorescence EEMs.

 __Component 2__ is corresponding to __peaks B__ (Ex:275 nm, Em:310 nm) and/or __peaks T__ (Ex:275 nm, Em:350 nm). It seems like a combination of __peaks T__ and __peaks B__. Whatever it would be a Protein-like fluorophore.

The second highest peak from __Component 3__ is corresponding to __peaks M__ (Ex: 312 nm, Em:380~420 nm).  It is probably a **humic-like** component.

__Component 4__ is probably a noise-derived component.

### Distribution of C1~C4

High correlation relationship is observed between **Component 1** and **Component 3**, which indicates similar source of these two components. Distribution of **Component 2** demonstrated the higher percentage of **autochthonous** fluorescence matter in Lake Michigan.

## Molecular weights of peak in size chromotography

$$ M_n = \frac{\sum M_i \cdot n_i}{\sum n_i}$$

$$ M_w = \frac{\sum M_i \cdot w_i}{\sum w_i} = \frac{\sum M_i^2 \cdot n_i}{\sum M_i \cdot n_i}$$

$$ DPI = \frac{M_w}{M_n}$$

Integration - UV1

Let's pay attention to the Sample **S3-0m** and Sample **S22B-0m**. They have two common things which are distinguished with other samples; they were collected at the center of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, and the percentage of **100 kDa ~0.7e-6 m** fraction were relatively low.

/>100 kDa fractionation in protein-like FDOM occupied averagely more than half of the integration (57.32%) in Lake Michigan. Meanwhile, the largest protein-like fractionation (>100 kDa) has greatest proportion of FDOM integration chromotography.
