Greetings. Welcome to my carapace.

This is Hui Lin from School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Here is my personal website under construction. I would like to share my learing, codings programs, and life here.

My major is oceanography, or specificlly marine chemistry.

Here is my backpage, my knowledge pool, and finally my carapace.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
